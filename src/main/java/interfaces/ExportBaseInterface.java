/**
 * Base interface for export functionality in the Excel generation process.
 * <p>
 * This interface serves as the foundational contract for all export-related
 * classes. It can be extended by other interfaces or implemented directly
 * by classes that provide the core functionality for exporting data.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Purpose:</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Defines a common type for all export-related components.</li>
 *   <li>Can be used to enforce polymorphism in the export architecture.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Extensibility:</h3>
 * Classes or interfaces extending {@code interfaces.ExportBaseInterface} can add
 * additional methods or refine the contract to suit specific export requirements.
 *
 * <h3>Usage Example:</h3>
 * <pre>{@code
 * public interface interfaces.ExportSimple extends interfaces.ExportBaseInterface {
 *     // Additional methods or specifications
 * }
 * }</pre>
